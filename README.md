# Customer Churn Prediction models
## Task
The taks is to predict customer churn 
## Data
- the dataset can be found in ./data/
- the data can also be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

## Models
This repository demonstrates the implementation of 3 models:
- XGB classifier
- Random Forest
- Simple Neural Network implemented with pytorch

## Results:
The 3 models achieve the following accuracies:
- XGB: 80%
- Random Forest: 81%
- Neural Network: 80%
